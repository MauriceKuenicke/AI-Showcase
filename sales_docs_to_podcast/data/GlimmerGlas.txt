GlimmerGlass — Internal Sales Brief

Confidential — For Internal Use Only
Version: 1.0 • Date: 25 Sep 2025

Executive Summary

GlimmerGlass™ is a next-gen protective packaging platform for specialized lab
equipment (precision pipettes, microfluidic chips, optics, sensors). It combines
a rigid, glass-clear PETG clamshell with a multilayer barrier liner and anti-static
coating, engineered for ETO, gamma, and steam sterilization workflows. In pilots,
customers reduced in-transit damage by 78–85%, cut pack-out time by 24%, and improved
shelf visibility without sacrificing sterility assurance.

Positioning: Premium, validation-ready packaging that reduces breakage, unboxing time, and shipping mass for high-value lab SKUs.
Target ASP: €4.20 per unit (volume tiered).
Gross Margin: 55% at standard volume.

Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

Genomics & Diagnostics OEMs (EU/US): high SKU value (€300–€3,000), global distribution, sterility or cleanliness critical.

Optics & Photonics Labs: scratch-sensitive components needing clear inspection at goods-in.

Microfluidics & BioMEMS Startups: frequent design revisions; need custom cavities without long tooling cycles.

Key Triggers: Damage rate >1%, complaints about haze/scratches, long pack-out, sterility rework, packaging change before scale-up.

Value Proposition (Quantified)

Breakage Reduction: From ~1.8% → 0.4% (pilot median).

Pack-Out Time: –24% via snap-fit, pre-sterile liners.

Freight Savings: –8–15% dimensional weight due to thinner walls & nested geometry.

Regulatory Lift: Pre-qualified to ISO 11607 with documented DQ/IQ/OQ templates.

Competitive Landscape (Short)

Rigid PVC clamshells: inexpensive, poor barrier, fogging, limited sterilization.

Foam + carton kits: good cushioning, poor cleanliness, slow pack-out, no visibility.

Tyvek® pouches w/ inserts: great sterility, poor crush resistance, no presentation.
GlimmerGlass differentiator: combines rigid protection + sterile-barrier liner + clear inspection in one SKU.

Pricing & Packaging
Tier	Annual Volume	Unit Price (EUR)	Lead Time	Notes
Launch	5k–24,999	€4.60	3–4 wks	Standard sizes
Growth	25k–99,999	€4.20	4–6 wks	Forecast lock 8 wks
Strategic	≥100k	€3.85	6–8 wks	VMI or consignment

MOQs: 2,500 per size; Tooling (custom cavity): €18–35k; Validation support pack: €12k (optional).
COGS (GG-M example): Materials €1.20 + Labor €0.35 + Overhead €0.25 + QA €0.10 = €1.90 → GM 54.8% at €4.20 ASP.

ROI Example (Use in Discovery Deck)

Customer: Genomics OEM shipping 30,000 chip cartridges/year
Current: 1.8% breakage × €1,250 unit value = €675,000 loss
With GlimmerGlass: 0.4% × €1,250 = €150,000 loss
Damage savings: €525,000
Packaging delta: (€4.20–€3.00) × 30,000 = €36,000 extra cost
Freight savings: €0.35 × 30,000 = €10,500
Net annual impact: €525,000 – €36,000 + €10,500 = €499,500
One-time enablement (tooling + validation): €120,000 → Payback ≈ 2.9 months

Sales Playbook

Elevator Pitch:
“GlimmerGlass pairs rigid protection with a sterile barrier and crystal-clear presentation, cutting damage by ~80% and pack-out by ~25%—without changing your sterilization workflow.”

Discovery Questions

What’s your current in-transit damage or return rate by SKU?

Sterilization method & maximum tolerated gamma/steam exposure?

Cleanroom class at packaging? Any bioburden limits?

Average order value and complaint handling cost?

Desired unboxing experience (inspection before opening, tamper evidence, RFID)?

Sustainability targets (PCR %, take-back, EPR)?

Land & Expand Motions

Start with a pilot SKU (highest damage/complaint rate).

Validate with our DQ/IQ/OQ templates; run ASTM D4169 distribution.

Expand to adjacent SKUs; introduce RFID tamper option and VMI.

Objection Handling

“Price premium.” → Quantify damage/freight savings; show 3-month payback.

“Regulatory burden.” → Provide ISO 11607 package validation dossier + sterilization compatibility matrix.

“Sustainability.” → Offer 35% PCR shell + take-back; mono-material aids recycling.

“Supply risk.” → Dual-site EU manufacturing; 12-week buffer in VMI.

Implementation Plan (Customer-Facing)

Week 0–2: Sample selection, fit check, ASTM D638 material certs, sterilization compatibility test strips.
Week 3–6: Pilot run (2,500–5,000 units), distribution testing (D4169), functional shelf-life accel (6 weeks @ 40 °C/75% RH).
Week 7–10: Validation report, SOP updates, packaging spec lock.
Week 11+: Ramp to volume; optional VMI.

Light Case Study (For Credibility)
